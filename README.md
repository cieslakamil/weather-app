Description: A website app with functionalites like checking current weather, forecast, and gps location

Working on branches: 
use very short names, so to checkout easily. 
One branch - one issue. 
Branches which are pushed to remote(github), are deleted only after being merged to 'main' branch.

current feature to work on:
1. current weather (extacly now) [place, rain, humidity, wind] //prototype done, more later
    - small animations, (sunny, cloudy, rain etc) //todo

2. map (getting user's location, in order to show 1.current weather and 5.air pollution)
    - clicking on map reevaluates displayed weather data (currently it does only on startup) //todo

4. daily forecast for 7 days. (with simple chart) //todo

5. air pollution (next to 1.current weather, displayed on demand with a button) //done

6. Settings (units, languagues) (provided by openweather.org) //todo
